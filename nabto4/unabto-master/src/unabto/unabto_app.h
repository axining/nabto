/**
 * application_event(), The uNabto application request
 * implementation. This is a function the implementor implements to
 * answer rpc requests. It has two modes, synchronous and
 * asynchronous. If AER_REQ_ACCEPTED is returned an asynchronous
 * request is initiated. All other return values does imply a
 * synchronous request.
 * 
 * @param appreq  the request information
 * @param r_b     buffer, holds the parameters
 * @param w_b     buffer, to retrieve the response message
 * @return        the result
 * - AER_REQ_RESPONSE_READY, the response must be written in the w_b
 * - AER_REQ_INV_QUERY_ID, the queryId is invalid
 * - AER_REQ_ACCEPTED, w_b isn't used. The unabto framework handles the request asynchronously.
 * - the remaining results values are sent to the Client as an exception (w_b is overridden by the caller).
 *
 * WARNING: The read and write buffer use a shared input and output
 * buffer. Before writing to the writeBuffer you need to read all the
 * data you need from the readBuffer.
 *
 * The size of the writeBuffer is limited by the config parameter
 * NABTO_RESPONSE_MAX_SIZE. The maximum request size is limited by the
 * config parameter NABTO_REQUEST_MAX_SIZE.
 *
 * Synchronous requests.
 *
 * A synchronous request is a request where the answer is sent
 * imediately back to the requestor. It is not allowed to block inside
 * the function since it blocks the whole system.
 * 
 * Example:
 * application_event_result application_event(application_request* applicationRequest, unabto_query_request* readBuffer, unabto_query_response* writeBuffer) {
 *     unabto_query_write_int32(writeBuffer, 42);
 *     return AER_REQ_RESPONSE_READY;
 * }
 *
 * Asynchronous requests.
 *
 * To initiate an asynchronous request the function needs to return
 * AER_REQ_ACCEPTED. When the application later has an answer ready to
 * the request, the application should send the opaque application_request pointer
 * back to unabto through the application_poll_query function. Unabto
 * then calls the function application_poll to retrieve the
 * response. After applcation_poll is returned, a call to
 * application_poll_drop is called. The application will need to copy
 * the required request parameters into its own scope. The
 * unabto_query_request pointer is invalid after returning from the
 * function.
 * 
 * Example:
 * static application_request* savedRequest = NULL;
 * application_event_result application_event(application_request* applicationRequest, unabto_query_request* readBuffer, unabto_query_response* writeBuffer) {
 *     if (savedRequest == NULL) {
 *         savedRequest = applicationRequest;
 *         return AER_REQ_ACCEPTED;
 *     } else {
 *         return AER_REQ_OUT_OF_RESOURCES;
 *     }
 * }
 * bool application_poll_query(application_request** applicationRequest) {
 *     if (savedRequest != NULL) { 
 *          *applicationRequest = savedRequest;
 *          return true;
 *     } else {
 *          return false;
 *     }
 * }
 * application_event_result application_poll(application_request* applicationRequest, unabto_query_response* writeBuffer) {
 *     unabto_query_write_int32(writeBuffer, 42);
 *     return AER_REQ_RESPONSE_READY;
 * }
 * void application_poll_drop(application_request* applicationRequest) {
 *     savedRequest = NULL;
 * }
